# Q-learning-on-Taxi-v3
Q-learning agent for the Taxi-v3 environment with a comparison of ε-greedy exploration strategies.

This project implements **Q-learning** on the OpenAI Gymnasium **Taxi-v3** environment.

The notebook compares three exploration strategies:
- High ε (high exploration)
- Low ε (low exploration)
- ε-decay (exploration → exploitation)

The notebook includes:
- Training curves (moving average rewards)
- Learned policy visualization
- ANSI-based episode animation
- Discussion of rewards vs steps

📓 Open the notebook to see full explanations and results.
